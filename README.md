# Pollution-and-Health-Impacts-Analysis
This project analyzes the relationship between air pollution levels and their impacts on public health across various countries. By examining AQI (Air Quality Index) values and pollutants like CO, Ozone, NO2, and PM2.5, we explore their effects on respiratory diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and mortality rates.
